      <h2>Accommodation</h2>
      You are invited to stay overnight at the venue, either in the lodge or camping out.

      <h2>Children</h2>
      The venue and atmosphere will be pretty kid-friendly, with lots of places to play and activites for them. 
      We just ask that during the short formal ceremony, kids who don't want to be quiet are occupied elsewhere.
